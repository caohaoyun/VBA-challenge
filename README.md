# vba-challenge

#used dim and loop to do all the calculations and analysis

#used Cells(x,y).value to set up new rows and columns

#used Range("z",row).value to output values or results found from loop

#logic behind looking for all unique tickers: if the next line has a new value from this line, then take the new value; otherwise keep the present value

#logic behind looking for total value for the current ticker: if the next value belongs to the same ticker as previous one, then add the value to sum; otherwise stop adding and start a new sum

#used built-in functions:max, min, ws to complete the calculation and make the module work for all worksheets all at once.
